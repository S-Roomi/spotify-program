### Spotify Playlist Duplicator

This program is currently a simple script that takes a spotify playlist and copies it into another one. It also removes duplicate songs. 

##### Dependencies
This program was coded in python 3.12

A spotify developer account is needed for the client id and secret. The only other information the program requires is a playlist id (the one to copy from) and its size (how many songs are in the playlist). These variables can be found and changed in main.
