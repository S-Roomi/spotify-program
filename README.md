### Spotify Playlist Duplicator

Still being worked on. Adding more functionality each day. So far, we can get user playlist and find and get songs from the playlist.
Currently working on adding songs to user playlist

##### Dependencies
This program was coded in python 3.12

A spotify developer account is needed for the client id and secret. The only other information the program requires is a playlist id (the one to copy from) and its size (how many songs are in the playlist). These variables can be found and changed in main.
